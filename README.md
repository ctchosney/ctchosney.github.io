- Mapping and GIS data is used to compare sites of queer nightlife in NYC and Tokyo in terms of quantity, location, and density. Analysis of these comparisons reveal that differing historical influences and sociocultural attitudes towards homosexuality between New York City and Tokyo have resulted in different urban layouts of these city’s queer nightlife sites.

### "A Restaurant Queuing Model to Inform Staffing" | July 2023

[Jupyter Notebook](assets/pdf/Final Project - Chosney.ipynb)

- A Python simulation models customer flow at a restaurant in order to inform appropriate staffing decisions. I have adapted code for simulating customer flow in a business to return a "cover count" for a typical five hour lunch, and have used my decade of hospitality experience to inform the model's logisitics and probabilities. Having a stochastic model for simulating cover counts and customer flow allows us to optimize staffing for both employee and employer gain.
